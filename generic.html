							<h2>Phishing Patterns</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where criminals impersonate 
						trusted people or services to trick victims into revealing credentials, clicking 
						malicious links, or sending money.</p>
						
						<p>  A "phishing pattern" refers to the recurring techniques attackers use. Such as 
						spoofed sender addresses, urgent or fear-based wording, malicious attachments or fake login pages, 
						URL obfuscation (Punycode/shorteners), and multi-channel follow ups (email → SMS → phone). Recognizing 
						the patterns of mismatched senders, unexpected requests, poor grammar, and requests for credentials or 
						payments helps users and defenders spot and stop phishing before it succeeds.</p>
						<hr />
						
						
						<h3>1. Fake Login Pages</h3>
						<p>Scammers build websites that look identical to real services like banks or shopping sites. 
							Their goal is to steal your username and password. Always double-check the URL, as phishing pages often contain strange spellings or extra words.</p>

						<h3>2. Urgent Action Scams</h3>
						<p>Phishing messages often try to scare you with warnings like “Your account will be closed” or “Unusual activity detected.” 
						 These pressure tactics are meant to make you click without thinking. Real companies rarely force instant action.</p>

						<h3>3. Suspicious Attachments</h3>
						<p>Attackers may send attachments disguised as invoices, receipts, or important documents. Opening them can install malware. 
							If you weren’t expecting a file, don’t open it and contact the sender using a verified method first.</p>

						<h3>4. Prize or Reward Scams</h3>
						<p>If you receive a message claiming you won a prize you never entered for, it’s almost always fake. 
							These scams try to get your personal information or lead you to malicious sites. Legitimate companies don’t ask for sensitive info to claim a prize.</p>

						<h3>5. Impersonation of Trusted Brands</h3>
						<p>Phishers often pretend to be popular companies, delivery services, or banks by copying their logos and design. 
							Even if the message looks real, always check the sender’s email address and the website domain for small but suspicious differences.</p>
